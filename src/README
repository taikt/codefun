Important note:
number of elements on vector/array: <= x.10^8
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3813124/c-vector-max-size
(10^9 size for 1-d vector of bool is ok)
vector<char> a(1e9): ok
vector<bool> a(1e9): ok
vector<int> a(1e9): not ok, because max size = 1e9 * 4 > int size
vector<int> a(1e8): ok, because max size = 1e8 * 4 < int size = 2 * 1e9

IMPOTARNT:
calculate max size in byte of vector or array must <= int max size: 2*1e9
i.e if using vector<int,int>[n][m], n,m <= 1e5
=> max size: 1e10 * 4 > max int size => not acceptable
(4: size of a int is 4 bytes
size of bool or char is 1 byte)

to < 1sec run, check O()

number of operations per second on PC <= 10^8
n <= 10 allowed O(n!)
n <= 20 -> O(2^n)
n <= 500 -> O(n^3)
n <= 5000 -> O(n^2)
n <= 10^6 -> O(nlogn) or O(n)
n > 10^6  -> O(1) or O(logn)

int(32bit to present a number): -2.10^9 - 2.10^9
long long (64bit to present a number): -9.10^18 - 9.10^18


** How to practice **
leetcode: to interview
codefores: to competitive programming

https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-see-solutions-on-Codeforces-for-any-problem-code

view editor solution on codefores: click Tutorial on a problem
to view user solutions: 
click to a problem
click link to the test (i.e codeforces round 898(div4))
click to last column of the problem (i.e x1234)
on status filter:
- verdict: accepted
- language: c++14
-> apply


How to solve:
1. check problem with available editior tutorial
2. read problem carefully
3. 5 min to think solution
 - check input constraint 
   -> check algorithm with suitable complexity to meet time limitation (1sec)
4. read editior tutorial
5. coding or read editor/user solutions
6. recoding and submit result
