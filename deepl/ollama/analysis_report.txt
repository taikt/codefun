Here is a simple report of potential issues in the provided C++ code, along with the corresponding line numbers and explanations:

---

**Line 10: Missing `break;` statement in `switch` case**  
**Explanation:** The `case 2` block does not have a `break;` statement, which can lead to *fall-through* behavior. This means the code will execute both `case 2` and `case 3` if `value` is 2, which is likely not intended.

---

**Line 20: Memory leak due to not deleting dynamically allocated memory**  
**Explanation:** The `leakMemory()` function allocates memory using `new int(42);` but does not call `delete` on the pointer `ptr`, resulting in a memory leak.

---

**Line 17: Redundant return statement after `switch`**  
**Explanation:** The `switch` statement already returns in `case 3`, and `default` also returns. However, the `return value;` on line 17 is still valid, but it's redundant in some cases. It's not an error, but it's unnecessary and can be removed for cleaner code.

---

**Summary of Issues:**

- **Line 10:** Missing `break;` in `case 2` (fall-through behavior)
- **Line 20:** Memory leak due to not deleting allocated memory
- **Line 17:** Redundant return statement (not an error, but can be removed)
