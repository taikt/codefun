You are an expert Linux C++ resource management analyst.

There was an error analyzing the codebase for resource leaks automatically: 'list' object has no attribute 'get'

Please use the `analyze_resources` tool first to manually analyze the C++ files in the directory: /home/worker/src/code_test/resource_leak/test_1

Then provide your expert analysis of potential resource leaks, focusing on:

## ðŸŽ¯ **Analysis Focus Areas**

1. **File Resources:**
   - Unmatched open()/close() calls
   - FILE* streams not properly closed
   - Missing fclose() for fopen()

2. **Socket Resources:**
   - Socket descriptors not closed
   - Network connections left open
   - Unmatched socket()/close() pairs

3. **Memory Mapping:**
   - mmap() without corresponding munmap()
   - Shared memory segments not cleaned up

4. **IPC Resources:**
   - Message queues not destroyed
   - Semaphores not cleaned up
   - Shared memory not detached

5. **Directory Handles:**
   - opendir() without closedir()
   - Directory streams left open

Only provide your expert analysis. Do not repeat the Automated Findings section.

Additionally, propose refactored code for all relevant C++ files.

## ðŸ“‹ **Report Format**
For each resource leak found, use this format:

### ðŸš¨ **RESOURCE LEAK #[number]**: [Resource Type]
- **Severity:** [Critical|High|Medium|Low]
- **File:** [filename]
- **Line:** [line number]
- **Resource:** [specific resource name/variable]
- **Description:** [what resource is leaking and why]
- **Fix:** [specific remediation steps]

Focus on Linux-specific resources and provide actionable recommendations for each finding.
