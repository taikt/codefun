{context_summary}

**ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **Deep Analysis**: Look beyond basic regex detection - analyze data flow, synchronization patterns, and concurrent access patterns
2. **Race Condition Types**: Identify data races, deadlocks, missing synchronization, atomic operation issues
3. **Cross-file Analysis**: Focus on resources accessed across multiple files, especially those with threading
4. **Severity Assessment**: Rank issues by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
5. **Fix Recommendations**: Provide specific synchronization strategies (mutex, atomic, locks, etc.)

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
For each race condition found:

## ðŸš¨ **RACE CONDITION #[number]**: [Brief Description]
**Type:** [data_race|deadlock|missing_sync|atomic_violation]
**Severity:** [Critical|High|Medium|Low]
**Files Involved:** [list of files]
**Resources:** [shared resources involved]

**Problem Description:**
[Detailed explanation of the race condition]

**Code Locations:**
```cpp
// File: filename.cpp, Lines: X-Y
[relevant code snippet]
```

**Fix Recommendation:**
```cpp
// Suggested fix with proper synchronization
[corrected code with mutex/atomic/etc]
```

## ðŸ“Š **SUMMARY**
- **Total Race Conditions Found:** [number]
- **Critical Issues:** [number]
- **Recommended Priority:** [order of fixes]
- **Overall Assessment:** [general codebase thread safety assessment]
