== send request synchronously ==
sa -> nadm: request 1

note over sb
request 2 is blocking until NAD Manager finishes request 1.
It causes Service B be blocked and end-to-end response time is large.
end note

note over sa
Service A is blocking until it receives response from NAD Manager.
Service A cannot do other job during waiting time.
