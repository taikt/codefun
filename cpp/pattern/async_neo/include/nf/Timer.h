/**
 * @ingroup nf_core_Executors
 * @brief The timer.
 *
 * @code
 * #include <nf/Timer.h>
 * @endcode
 *
 * This class provides an interface to create and control timers. A timer is defined by a
 * @ref Task it needs to execute and an interval at which to execute this task.
 *
 * @par Periodic Timers
 *
 * Periodic timers execute the task at constant intervals. To construct a periodic timer the
 * task needs to return @e true.
 *
 * This code will execute @c doSomething() each ten seconds until the timer is explicitly
 * stopped.
 *
 * @code
 * auto timer = nf::Timer::construct(10s, [] {
 *     doSomething();
 *     return true;
 * });
 * timer->start();
 * @endcode
 *
 * @par Single-shot Timers
 *
 * Single-shot timers execute the task only once after the specified interval. To construct
 * a single-shot timer the task needs to return @e false.
 *
 * This code will execute @c doSomething() only once after ten seconds.
 *
 * @code
 * auto timer = nf::Timer::construct(10s, [] {
 *     doSomething();
 *     return false;
 * });
 * timer->start();
 * @endcode
 *
 * An alternative to single-shot timers is @ref Executor::post(Delay,Task&&).
 *
 * @par Thread Affinity and Safety
 *
 * When created, the timer is bound to a specific @ref Executor and its thread. The task will
 * be executed in a context of this thread. The @ref construct() method constructs a timer
 * for the current thread. Executor's @nfrefmethod{Executor,makeTimer()} constructs a timer
 * for that executor.
 *
 * This class is @b NOT thread safe. It must be accessed only from the thread it has been
 * created for.
