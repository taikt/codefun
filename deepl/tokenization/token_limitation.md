Token limits for AI models (as of 2024–2025) depend on the specific model and provider:

- **OpenAI GPT-3.5**: Up to 16,385 tokens per request (input + output).
- **OpenAI GPT-4 (8k context)**: Up to 8,192 tokens per request.
- **OpenAI GPT-4 (32k context)**: Up to 32,768 tokens per request.
- **Anthropic Claude 2**: Up to 100,000 tokens per request (input + output).
- **Google Gemini/PaLM 2**: Typically 8,000–32,000 tokens, depending on tier.

**Best practice:**  
- Keep prompts well below the model’s max (e.g., 2,000–4,000 tokens for production) to allow room for output and ensure fast, reliable responses.
- Always check the latest documentation for your specific provider and model, as limits may change.

In your report, the optimized prompt (~2,310 tokens) is well within the safe range for all major models.
