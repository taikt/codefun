Question:
non-functional requirement to map with Quality attribute?
Use case diagram?
add tiger extension?

Review:
external first -> then internal : (i.e dynamic part)
all parts related to Nad manager/nad proxy (if not, remove it, i,e tiger extension part)


//taikt
Need traceoff analysis between QA (especially performance and scalability)
Consider remove Hardware system page, keep only system achrictecture view
Check other best practices for naming project (specifically or abstraction)

Pros and cons for each design options

For tiger proposal
Indicate for event loop in tiger
Every app use a same event loop in tiger library
But event loop only support messages-based event, not task-based event
Need good lib for asynchronous lib that reused by every app in common lib.
=> add async helper lib
