/**
 * @ingroup nf_core_Executors
 * @brief The thread.
 *
 * This class represents a single thread of execution with a running event loop (@ref Executor).
 * One can @ref post() tasks to be executed in a context of this new thread.
 *
 * A new thread is created together with a @c Thread object. After that, one can immediately
 * start @ref post() "posting" tasks. They will be executed in a context of the new thread
 * as soon as it becomes active and an event loop is created.
 *
 * Posted tasks are executed in the order they were posted. The tasks are not executed if the
 * executor for that thread is stopped.
 *
 * The thread will remain active and accept new tasks until it is @ref join() "joined".
 *
 * @par Thread-safety
 *
 * All public methods of a @c Thread object must be invoked only from the thread where this
 * object was created.
 *
 * @par Strict contract
 *
 * Multi-threaded programming is a source of errors. In order to ensure that this class is
 * used correctly, it implements a "terminate a program if the contract is violated" rule.
 *
 * @par Example
 *
 * One can use this class to execute some tasks in a worker thread, e.g.:
 * @code
 * nf::Thread m_thread;
 * ...
 * void doStuff()
 * {
 *     m_thread.post([] {
 *         // Invoked in a context of a worker thread
 *         auto result = doSomethingHeavy();
 *         nf::Executor::mainThread()->post([result] {
 *             // Invoked again in a context of the main thread
 *             process(result);
 *         });
 *     });
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @since 3.11
 *
 * @see @ref nf_exec_ExecutionModel_StartStop "Execution Model: Starting and Stopping"
 *
