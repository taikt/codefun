 * @brief The I/O watch.
 *
 * This class represents an instance of an I/O watch. It's purpose is to watch for some events
 * on a file descriptor in an event loop aware manner.
 *
 * @par Example
 *
 * This code will notify the event loop (of the current thread) when a file descriptor has
 * data to be read.
 *
 * @code
 * #include <nf/IoWatch.h>
 *
 * m_watch = nf::IoWatch::construct(m_fd, POLLIN, [](std::int16_t events) {
 *     if ((events & POLLIN) != 0) {
 *         process(m_fd);
 *     }
 *     return false;
 * });
 * m_watch->start();
 * @endcode
 *
 * @par Thread-safety
 *
 * This class is not thread safe. It must be accessed only from a thread it has been created
 * for.

     * This is a type of an action executed by a watch when an event of a watched type occurs.
     * A task must not throw exceptions. It must not delete a watch which invokes this task.
     *
     * The task must accept an @c int16_t (a.k.a. @c short). It contains a bit mask of occurred
     * events. See a manual for <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/poll.2.html">
     * poll()</a> for what the bits mean.
     *
     * The task must return a boolean. If it returns @e true, the watch will remain active.
     * Note, that in this case the task must consume the I/O event, otherwise the task will
     * be again immediately posted to the event loop. This might result in a busy looping.
     * If it returns @e false, the watch will be stopped.
