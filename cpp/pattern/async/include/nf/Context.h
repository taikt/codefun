     * The wrapper returns a @ref Future with the @c std::optional.

     * If this instance of @ref Context is @ref reset() "reset" or destroyed, the wrapper

     * lambda) are freed. The no-op function returns a default-constructed value of its
     * return type, unless it is a void function.
     *
     * @note The wrapper returns an object of type @c Future<std::optional<T>> where @c T is a type
     * of object returned by @p f. If the  @c T is @c void then object's type is @c
     * Future<std::monostate>. @c Future<std::nullopt> object is returned if context was deleted.
